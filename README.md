# Minimalist-robots-RBNs
Paper name: "Minimalist exploration strategies for robot swarms at the edge of chaos"

# Installation
For running the experiment you need the ARGoS3 Simulator and the ARGoS Kilobot plugin. You can simple run " installation_folder/install_argos.sh" and "installation_folder/install_kilobot_plugin.sh" to install those. After this, run "installation_folder/first_build.sh" to build the experiment.

# Running the experiments
In this repository there are include 4 main scripts:
- "scripts/fpt_evaluation.py"
- "scripts/GeneticAlgorithm.py"
- "scripts/post_evaluation.py"
- "scripts/network_behaviour_analysis.py"
